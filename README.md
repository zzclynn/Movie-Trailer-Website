Inspired by the first project from the [Udacity - Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). This project aims to help understand how to use python to create a mini website from 0.

Steps

1. A movie class shall be defined in order to properly describe main features of a movie. In this project, the movie class includes the following movie features: _movie name_, _movie storyline_, _a link to youtube trailer_, _a link to the wiki poster_ and the _director name_.
2. Input the information mentioned above for couples of movies in the __entertainment_ceter.py__.
3. A python file named __fresh_tomatoes.py__ has been provided by Udacity for the webpage's layout. 
4. Calling the function __open_movies_page__ defined in __fresh_tomatoes.py__ from __entertainment_ceter.py__,  will generate a new webpage includes the movie information added in the previous step.

Future work

The movie information in this version have to be collected and entered manually. A future version of this project should be able to crawl data from some movie source website, such as IMDb.
